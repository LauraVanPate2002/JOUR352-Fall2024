                    <h2>Twenty-two Division I college football players have died since 2000 from exertion-related illnesses suffered during a workout or practice, according to an analysis by the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism and The Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism at the University of Maryland.

                    Yet football programs and coaches face few repercussions from institutions or the NCAA, even when they violate recommended safety precautions that might have prevented death.</h2>
                    
                    <p>The causes of death include collapse from sickle cell trait, heatstroke and sudden cardiac arrest — all largely preventable, medical experts say.</p>
                    <p>The NCAA has taken steps in the past two decades to address these deaths, and although that includes several rules changes, the association also has issued recommendations that do not carry penalties and sometimes are not followed by athletics programs.</p>
                    <p>There have been no fatalities in Division I since 2018, but earlier this week a Division II player died during a preseason practice. The cause remains under investigation. Regardless, experts say the risk to football players remains, and that coaches need to be held accountable for dangerous workouts and training sessions.</p>
                    <p>NCAA chief medical officer Brian Hainline said he recognizes there is a “gap” when it comes to holding coaches and programs responsible.</p>
                    <p>“That’s sort of the next step. … How do we actually legislate health and safety?” Hainline said.</p>
                    <p>Some state and federal legislators have looked to regulate college athletics in ways that go beyond the NCAA’s recommendations concerning athlete safety.</p>
                    <p>“We need to create enforceable protocols that have consequences when young people’s health is being compromised,” said Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J, in an interview with the Howard Center. Booker, who played football at Stanford, introduced a College Athletes Bill of Rights in December and has discussed a similar measure during this Congressional session.</p>
                    <p>“I just think there’s a lot more work to be done to really secure the safety of college athletes. If there is no accountability, it’s hard to drive change.”</p>
