    <h1> Top 25 Baseball Players in OPS Standings 2024 and which Teams Had the Best OPS Players</h1>
    
    <h2>Laura Van Pate Data Visualization Project</h2>
    
    <h3>By: Laura Van Pate</h3>
    
    <p>My project compares the top 25 baseball players in terms of OPS during the 2024 MLB Season and what team had the most players in the top 25.</p> 
    
    <p>The first chart tells which players had the highest OPS, and the one that had the most was Michael Harris. The second chart tells which teams had the most players in the top 25 OPS standings and it looks like it's a tie between the Cleveland Guardians and the Los Angeles Dodgers.</p>
   
    <p>These charts matters because it can predict how far teams can make it to the playoffs as OPS determines how oftern a player can get on baseball and poetentially score. All the teams on this list with the exception of the Atlanta Braves made the playoffs, however when comparing the team with the least amount of players, the Baltimore Orioles, lost in the first round of the playoffs, whereas the team that won the World Series, the Los Angeles Dodgers, is tied with the most players in the top 25 OPS Standings.</p> 
    
    <p>I believe this chart also proves that number of players matter as opposed to the best player because the Atlanta Braves had the best player Michael Harris in terms of OPS standings, but didn't make the playoffs.</p>
